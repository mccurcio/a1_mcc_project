HOW TO WRITE AN ABSTRACT

- The purpose of an abstract is to summarize the major aspects of a argumentative essay or paper, but it is important to bear in mind they are descriptions of your project, not the topic in general.

- Descriptive abstract – only describes the work being summarized without comparing it to other papers on the given subject

- Informative abstract – most common type of abstracts, the researcher explains and presents the main arguments and most important results. While it doesn’t compare one work to others on the same subject, informative abstract includes conclusions of the research and recommendations of the author

- What is the content of an abstract?
    1. Background, gap in literature
    2. Research question
    3. Methods used to address the gap in literature
    4. Main results
    5. Interpretation
Each of these points should be addressed in only a few sentences
