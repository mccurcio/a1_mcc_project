1. Introduction
   - `caret` works with everything!
   - So far it works with over 200 models, See: web page
   - caret will help you tune also!
   - Generally:
     - Data Preparation and Preprocessing
     - Visualize the importance of variables
     - Feature Selection using RFE
     - Training and Tuning the model
     - Model Evaluation


2. Initial Setup â€“ load the package and dataset
   - [Brief Introduction to caretEnsemble](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caretEnsemble/vignettes/caretEnsemble-intro.html)


3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing  
   3.1. How to split the dataset into training and validation?  
    3.2. Descriptive statistics  
    3.3. How to impute missing values using preProcess()?  
    3.4. How to create One-Hot Encoding (dummy variables)?  
    3.5. How to preprocess to transform the data?  
      - range: Normalize values so it ranges between 0 and 1
      - center: Subtract Mean
      - scale: Divide by standard deviation
      - BoxCox: Remove skewness leading to normality. Values must be > 0
      - YeoJohnson: Like BoxCox, but works for negative values.
      - expoTrans: Exponential transformation, works for negative values.
      - pca: Replace with principal components
      - ica: Replace with independent components
      - spatialSign: Project the data to a unit circle

5. How to do feature selection using recursive feature elimination (`rfe`)?


6. Training and Tuning the model  
   6.1. How to `train()` the model and interpret the results?  
   6.2. How to compute variable importance?  
   6.3. Prepare the test dataset and predict  
   6.4. Predict on test data  
   6.5. Confusion Matrix  


7. How to do hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model for better performance?  
   7.1. Setting up the `trainControl()`  
   7.2. Hyperparameter Tuning using `tuneLength`

8. How to evaluate the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms?  
   8.1. Training Adaboost  
   8.2. Training Random Forest  
   8.3. Training xgBoost Dart  
   8.4. Training SVM  
   8.5. Run `resamples()` to compare the models  


9. Ensembling the predictions  
   9.1. How to ensemble predictions from multiple models using `caretEnsemble`?  
   9.2. How to combine the predictions of multiple models to form a final prediction  


10. Conclusion
