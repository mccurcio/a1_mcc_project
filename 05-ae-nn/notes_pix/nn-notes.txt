Should you use a neural network?

Advantages:

    Neural networks work for both classification and regression
    Very good predictive performance, even with complex problems like image recognition
    Can approximate almost any function, including non-linear functions

Disadvantages:

    Prone to over-fitting
    Tuning parameters are required (number of nodes, layers)
    Provides little insight into the data (black box model)
    Can be computationally intensive
