We will apply an unsupervised deep learning Autoencoder.

An autoencoder is a neural network that learns a representation or encoding of a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction.

For the first task we will procede as if we have no labels on the data and simple try to identify suspicious anomalies in the data.

After building the models we will use the labels to discover if this approach will be useful.
