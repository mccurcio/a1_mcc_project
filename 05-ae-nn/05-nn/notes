Feed Forward NN

each neuron in the chain has its own properties. EAch neuron or perceptron has its own weights leading into the summation function and activation function

As we saw in the logistical regression system we have

Pix
N inputs each with its own signal strength n which to be summed. After which the summed signals are sent to an acitvation function with its own bias and slew rate. 

$$\overrightarrow{z} = f(\overrightarrow{x}, \overrightarrow{w}, \overrightarrow{T})$$

$$Y' %>% \sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i$$
