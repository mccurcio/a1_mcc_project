The files in this folder are derived from THE two proteins sets *.fasta files in folder "/a1_mcc_project/00-data/aac_dpc_values/ORIGINAL_DATA".  

- C = denotes control protein set; human proteins not related to myoglobin or hemoglobin.
- M = denotes protein set which are myoglobin related but different species.
- C+M = is a concatenation of the control and myoglobin proteins.
- aac = indicates single amino acid percent composition calculations.
- dpc = indicates di-peptide percent conposition calculations.

- c_m_RAW_AAC.csv = this file contains 'c'ontrol and 'm'yoglobin derived proteins with only the single amino acid calculations carried out. The RAW indicates that this data has not be transformed or changed.

- c_m_TRANSFORMED = this file contains both 'c'ontrol and 'm'yoglobin protein sets, but the columns {C: cysteine, F:phenylalanine, I:isoluecine} have been transformed with a squareroot function, inorder to reduce skew.
