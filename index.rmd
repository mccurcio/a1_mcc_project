## Welcome {-}

I started this project because I believed this area of study was most interesting and that teaching myself this topic would carry me threw the next couple of years. 

### Who This Book Is For {-}

This book is for me. It is very informal like myself. It is my record of how I taught myself R, RStudio and Machine Learning via fits and starts. 

The work was undertaken to fulfill the requirements of a Masters degree for Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the Department of Bioinformatics, a.k.a. Computational Biology.

### Acknowledgments {-}

I would like to thank Doctors Dmitry Korkine and (Randy Paffenroth(?)) for their patience and generosity.

### Dedication {-}

To my parents, Richard & Susan Curcio

### About the Author {-}

Matthew C. Curcio is a chemist, biochemist, teacher and student who loves science. I loved teaching but I loved science more.

The first time I realized Data Science was a bonafide subsection of science was the day I saw a fellow scientist make a kludgey mishmash with Visual Basic and an Excel spreadsheet.
