# Preface

## Welcome {-}

This is work has had more lifetimes than a bag full of cats.  It started off as a hands-on Linux command line guide for new biology students.

However, as I was reading on the topic of Linux, I read a quote that describes the philosophy of Unix.

>The Unix philosophy is one of simple tools, each doing one job well...  
>Anonymous

**This is not the philosophy of R nor RStudio.**  I am currently looking for an R package that fits the Unix motto.

As I stepped back-and-forth *and* back-and-forth, I realized I was more interested in teaching myself machine learning using Caret, R and RStudio.

### Who This Book Is For {-}

This book is for me and Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the fulfillment of my Masters degree.

It is very informal. It is my record of what I believed would help me in the near future. 

### Acknowledgments {-}

I would like to thank Doctors Dmitry Korkine and Elizabeth Ryder for their patience and generosity.

### Dedication {-}

To Richard and Susan Curcio

### About the Author {-}

Matthew C. Curcio is a chemist, biochemist, teacher and student who loves science. I loved teaching but I loved science more.

The first time I realized Data Science was a bonafide subsection of science was the day I saw a fellow scientist make a kludgey mishmash with Visual Basic and an Excel spreadsheet.
