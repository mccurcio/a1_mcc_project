- Examples of this type of analysis include protein structure prediction, gene classification, cancer classification based on microarray data, statistical modeling of protein-protein interaction, etc.

Good Definition
- Bioinformatics defined as the application of computer technology to the mana information. Bioinformatics is the science of storing, extracting, organizing, a information from biological sequences and molecules.

- It has been mainly fueled by advances in DNA sequencing
and mapping techniques. The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes.


Some of the grand area of research in bioinformatics include:

- Sequence analysis
- 2.2. Genome annotation
2.3. Analysis of gene expression
2.4. Analysis of protein expression
2.5. Analysis of mutations in cancer
2.6. Protein structure prediction
2.7. Comparative genomics
2.8. Modeling biological systems
2.9. High-throughput image analysis
2.10. Protein-protein docking

Data mining is also sometimes called Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD).
Data Mining approaches seem ideally suited for Bioinformatics, since it is data-rich, but lacks a comprehensive
theory of life’s organization at the molecular level.


Data mining tasks

two "high-level" primary goals of data mining, in practice, are prediction and description.

- Classification: Classification is learning a function that maps (classifies) a data item into one of several predefined
classes.
- Estimation: Given some input data, coming up with a value for some unknown continuous variable.
- Prediction: Same as classification & estimation except that the records are classified according to some future
behavior or estimated future value).
- Association rules: Determining which things go together, also called dependency modeling.
- Clustering: Segmenting a population into a number of subgroups or clusters.
Description & visualization: Representing the data using visualization techniques.


Learning from data falls into two categories: directed (“supervised”) and undirected (“unsupervised”) learning.


MAKE A FIGURE FROM:
The first three tasks – classification, estimation and prediction – are examples of supervised learning. The next three
tasks – association rules, clustering and description & visualization – are examples of unsupervised learning. In
unsupervised learning, no variable is singled out as the target; the goal is to establish some relationship among all
the variables. Unsupervised learning attempts to find patterns without the use of a particular target field.
