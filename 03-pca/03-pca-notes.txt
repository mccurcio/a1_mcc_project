Principal component analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an rotation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is often a vital step in the determination of more complex dimension reductions.

We have already applied PCA to the data in the earlier example.

Strength

👍 can be efficiently applied to large data sets

😄 has many extensions that deal with special situation such as sparse PCA when data has many missing values, kernel PCA can provide more robust solutions

😆 preserves global structures

Weaknesses

😨 may suffer from scale problems, i.e. when one variable dominates the variance simply because it is in a higher scale (for example if one variable is measured in mm instead of km); some of these scale problems can simply be dealt with by centering and scaling

😨 suffers from crowding in the presence of large numbers of observations, i.e. points do not form clusters but instead occupy the entire plotting space

👿 is susceptible to big outliers
